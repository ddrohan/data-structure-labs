#Step 2 - Refactor class FileHandler

In this lab, unlike previous labs, no new classes need to be created. All that is required is to refactor the array of Devices and update to a 'List' of Devices (implemented as an ArrayList.

The <c1><b>FileHandler</b></c1> class will need to be refactored so that the two methods which will write our Devices to a file and read our data back from the file, can now handle a List.


You should refer to the lecture notes if necessary, as everything you need to complete this step is in there.
