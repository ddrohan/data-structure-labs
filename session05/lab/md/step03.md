#Step 3 - Refactor class DvdManager

A bit of work needs to be done in the <c1><b>DvdManager</b></c1> class to complete this Lab. 

You need to

- modify the DeviceList declaration and creation, this will involve some coding in the constructor for <c1><b>DvdManager</b></c1>

- modify your "Add Device" method so a Device object can be added to the List. 

- modify the "Play Device" method to process a List instead of an array
