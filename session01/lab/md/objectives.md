#Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to develop and run a basic Eclipse Project based on managing <b>DVDs</b>, called <b>DSProject.Ver.1.0</b>.

The finished application allows a user to 

- 'add' a Dvd, where they enter the relevant details via a UI menu

- 'play' a Dvd based on entering the Dvd ID number and

- 'list' all Dvds currently in the 'database'
