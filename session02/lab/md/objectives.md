#Objectives

In this Lab, you will be required to refactor your Eclipse Project from Lab 1 based on managing DVDs, and develop a new project called <c1><b>DSProject.Ver.2.0</b></c1> (as seen below).

The finished application allows a user to 

- 'add' a 'Device', (ie a DVD or a CD) where they enter the relevant details via a UI menu

- 'play' a 'Device' based on entering the Device ID number and

- 'list' all 'Devices' (both DVDs & CDs) currently in the 'database'

and will look like the following
